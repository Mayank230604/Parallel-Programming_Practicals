# Parallel Programming Practicals

This repository contains practical implementations of core parallel algorithms using OpenMP in C. These programs were created as part of the Parallel Computing Lab course.

## Programs Included
- Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (OpenMP)
- Distributed Histogram Sorting (OpenMP)
- Breadth-First Search (OpenMP)
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (OpenMP)

Each program demonstrates how traditional algorithms can be parallelized to improve performance on multi-core processors.

These practicals were tested and executed on Ubuntu using the GCC compiler with OpenMP support.
